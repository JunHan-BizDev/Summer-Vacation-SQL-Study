--Find how many lecture courses each student takes.

/* Why used sub-query? */
-- 1. we have to use left join to count students who don't take any class 
-- 2. To prevent the duplication of studentName, using inner join is required. 

/* Querying without using sub-query */
SELECT StudentName, StudentID, count(SutdentID) AS Cnt

LEFT JOIN sutdents.StudentID = studentCourses.StudentID
GROUP BY StudentID, StudentName; 

--Grouping by two columns :: 1. studentID, 2. studentName
